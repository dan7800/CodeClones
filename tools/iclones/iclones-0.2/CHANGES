    iClones Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verison 0.1.2:
   - Fixed some bugs with the token transformations:
     - Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException that occurred with some c/c++ files.
     - Include remover for c/c++ does not remove all string literals from the
       file anymore.
   - Transformations on the token stream can be toggled with a command line
     switch now.
   - Known issue: The array initializer transformation may remove too many
                  tokens due to a bug in the underlying 3rd-party scanner
                  library. This can be avoided by disabling the transformator.

Version 0.1.1:
   - Significant reduction of memory consumption. (Fixed memory leaks)
   - Operations on the generalized suffix tree are faster now.
   - Writes some metadata when RCF is chosen as output format. This data
     include: Time and host of the detection run, arguments, Java-VM arguments.
   - The usage now reports the SVN revision used to build iclones.
   - Fixed a bug in the incremental updating of the generalized suffix tree.
     This bug may have caused the construction of partially wrong tree
     structures in the incremental detection. It virtually never caused a
     crash, but it may have affected precision and recall of the results to
     some extend.
   - Known issue: If files contain unicode escape characters, the positions
     of the reported clones may be shifted by some characters.

Version 0.1:
    inital relase
